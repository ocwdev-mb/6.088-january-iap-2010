Course Description
------------------

Ever hang your head in shame after your Python program wasn't as fast as your friend's C program? Ever wish you could use objects without having to use Java? Join us for this fun introduction to C and C++! We will take you through a tour that will start with writing simple C programs, go deep into the caves of C memory manipulation, resurface with an introduction to using C++ classes, dive deeper into advanced C++ class use and the C++ Standard Template Libraries. We'll wrap up by teaching you some tricks of the trade that you may need for tech interviews.

We see this as a "C/C++ empowerment" course: we want you to come away understanding

1.  why you would want to use C over another language (control over memory, probably for performance reasons),
2.  why you would want to use C++ rather than C (objects), and
3.  how to be useful in C and C++.

Prerequisites
-------------

We target this course to those with some degree of comfort programming (in Python, Scheme, Java, etc.) who want to become comfortable with using C/C++. No C/C++ experience expected.

More advanced memory manipulation in C. We'll show double linked-list insert in place, inserting into a linked list using a double pointer, corner cases of using memory (when we actually need heap allocation), etc.
